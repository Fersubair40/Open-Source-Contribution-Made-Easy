# Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy

This repository has small applications which are easier for beginners to understand and 
contribute to Open Source.

Check out this [post on dev.to](https://dev.to/vardhanapoorv16/making-contributing-to-open-source-easy-through-a-simple-repo-162l) 
for some details. 

Also note even though we have minimal-work issues, which essentially are one liner changes, 
we would **NOT** be accepting PRs with only those issues as your contribution. You need to have atleast one non minimal-work issue linked in same PR. 
If you are not interested in completing Hacktober Fest and just want to learn how to make contributions, this would be your go to issue. 
(Even though PR would be rejected you would still learn how to create one). 

There is one specific project, which could be your first PR. It lists the contributors on this repository. 
Add your name to contributors list, and after we have merged your PR, it would be available on below mentioned link. 
Check out this [issue](https://github.com/vardhanapoorv/Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy/issues/10) for details.

For Beginners, before you wander around our repo to start creating PR, 
read posts mentioned in this [Hacktober Fest details page](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details). 
It will give you a gist of how to create PRs.

For Everyone, Quality is more important the Quantity. Even though these projects are not real world use case projects, treat them like one. 
Maintainers of this repo will be active during October month and you need to make sure that your PR is upto the standards of getting accepted,
else it would be marked as invalid.
